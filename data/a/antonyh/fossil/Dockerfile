###
#   Dockerfile for Fossil 
#
#   Although it works fine, there is a one little thing which is not 100%
#   correct: the fossil repository is created at Docker image creation time,
#   which means everyone using the same docker image will have the same
#   server ID and project ID.
#
# This is a fork of nijtmans/fossil, changed to use ubuntu & apt-get
# The fossil commands have also been changed to work with v1.27
#
