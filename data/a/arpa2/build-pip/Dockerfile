# Dockerfile for ARPA2 build preparation (binutils)
#
# This is arpa2/buildphase-binutils -- an image based
# on debian:stable via arpa2/base and enhanced with
# software that we use to build ARPA2 binaries.
#
# Other layers can include this one as their basis,
# do some building and restart with another FROM that
# then copies from the build phase.  Tag this image
# arpa2/buildphase-pip to match with the FROM of such
# preparing build phases.
#
# See:
# https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/
