# injecting some packages into the base ubuntu image
# - ca-certificats [~2 MB]
#     openssl and certificats to support secure https connections
# - vim [~30 MB]
#     one of the things that have rocked linux since the beginning
# - curl [~20 MB]
#     very useful during deployment operations
# - openssh-client [~17 MB]
#     so we are able to connect to the outside world from inside the container
# - nettools [~1MB]
#     helps in diagnosing network related stuff and has very small footprint
# - git [~50 MB]
#     essential on management of anything, footprint is quite high though
