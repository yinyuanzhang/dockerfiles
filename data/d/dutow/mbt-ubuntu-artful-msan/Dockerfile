# A simple dockerfile for building MySQL / Percona server
# Source and build directories should be mounted under work
# Use with the work-with script
# This file is intended for building it with MSAN
# Currently this requires either a custom built clang (not included in this image),
# or a workoround commit in the sources to fix an initialization crash.
