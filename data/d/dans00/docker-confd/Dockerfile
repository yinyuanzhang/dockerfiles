# Update package index when we install nginx
# TODO: Replace once we have a confd package to install:
#RUN apk add --update s6 confd
RUN apk add --update s6

# Copy over our bootup routines.
# These get config from etcd, and launches any services in the container
COPY docker-init /docker-init

# This is a thorn in my side. There is no good way to get certificate+key files
# delivered into the container on create. Hence, we do it this way.
VOLUME ["/docker-init/ssl"]

# init.sh copies the s6 services to a temporary location and starts s6-svscan
# The copying is not strictly necessary (we could launch s6-svscan directly),
#  but I like this approach better, and the paths are shorter (/s6/<service>).
