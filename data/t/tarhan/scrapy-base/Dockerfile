  # 'runtime' enlist OS packages contains libraries needed by Python packages
  # to work. For example, lxml Python package uses libxml2 and libxslt libraries
  # at runtime.
  # 'buildtime' enlist OS packages contains header files needed by Python packages
  # while pip installing them. For example, lxml Python package uses lixml2-dev
  # and libxslt-dev during its installation process. This list does not include
  # standard OS packages needed at build time like gcc or cmake.
