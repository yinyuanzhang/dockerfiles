# The FROM instruction sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.
# As such, a valid Dockerfile must have FROM as its first instruction.
FROM node:12

# The MAINTAINER instruction allows you to set the Author field of the generated images.

# The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.

# The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD,
# ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
WORKDIR /data/www/current

# The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src>
# and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>.
# TL;DR https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/dockerfile-add-vs-copy/
# Use COPY

# The VOLUME instruction creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it
# as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers.
