# There are different ENV vars to consider when running Fedora Commons.

# In many circumstances, it is desirable to have a single copy of a Tomcat binary distribution shared among multiple users on the same server. To make this possible, you can set the CATALINA_BASE environment variable to the directory that contains the files for your 'personal' Tomcat instance.

# When running with a separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, the files and directories are split as following:

# In CATALINA_BASE:
#   bin - Only: setenv.sh (*nix) or setenv.bat (Windows), tomcat-juli.jar
#   conf - Server configuration files (including server.xml)
#   lib - Libraries and classes, as explained below
#   logs - Log and output files
#   webapps - Automatically loaded web applications
#   work - Temporary working directories for web applications
#   temp - Directory used by the JVM for temporary files>

# In CATALINA_HOME:
#   bin - Startup and shutdown scripts
#   lib - Libraries and classes, as explained below
#   endorsed - Libraries that override standard "Endorsed Standards". By default it's absent.
# "

# For Willow purposes:
# CATALINA_HOME is set by the Tomcat Docker image. There should be no need to change it.
# CATALINA_BASE is the directory where settings specific to the Fedora Commons app need to be held.

# As per the description above, certain directories in CATALINA_BASE are static assets (bin, conf, lib)
# while certain directories change during runtime (logs, webapps, work, temp).
# The static directories should be baked into the image. The writeable directories should be mounted as volumes.
# In this case this would result in 3 extra volumes, none of which are particularly useful.

# For Willow, it is easier to make the entire CATALINA_BASE a volume. That means that when the volume is mounted at container
# start-up, everything done inside CATALINA_BASE in this Dockerfile is going to disappear (unless it's being run on a
# local developer workstation). All actions that need to be taken inside CATALINA_BASE should be taken in the docker-entrypoint.sh,
# not here.
# What we do here is to add all static assets to a static directory, WILLOW_FEDORA_STATIC_DIR. Those will be symlinked
# into CATALINA_BASE by docker-entrypoint.sh on each container start-up.

# The final result after the container starts is something like this:
# ls -l $CATALINA_BASE
#   bin -> $WILLOW_FEDORA_STATIC_DIR/bin
#   conf -> $WILLOW_FEDORA_STATIC_DIR/conf
#   lib -> $WILLOW_FEDORA_STATIC_DIR/lib
#   logs
#   webapps
#     ROOT.war -> $WILLOW_FEDORA_STATIC_DIR/webapps/ROOT.war
#   work
#   temp
