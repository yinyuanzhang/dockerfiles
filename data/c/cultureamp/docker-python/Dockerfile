# The yapf version is fixed to 0.11.0. This is is because the latest release, i.e. 0.11.1,
# no longer exits with status 2 if the source code is not formatted when yapf --diff is run.
# We used this to fail the build if the source code is not formatted. The current exit code is 0
# whether the code is formatted or not. The latest release was supposed to make exit code
# customisable so that users can set their own exit code. But this doesn't work yet.
