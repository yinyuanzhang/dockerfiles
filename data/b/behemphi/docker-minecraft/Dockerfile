# The EULA is a file that is written out the first time the server is started 
# only if it does not exist. We are going to drop the needed KV pair and

# Changing the configuration properties of the server at run time 
# is enabled through the start.sh script. Unlike the EULA, we must enable
# run time server config so users don't have know about rebuilding a container
# each time they want to change a setting.
