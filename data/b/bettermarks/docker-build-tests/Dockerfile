FROM node:8.1.4-alpine
# if there are any problems with using alpine, you can remove the `-alpine` from the former line.
# (this will at least double the size of the resulting image)
# this also requires the following changes:
# * remove the lines for the next three **layers** from the docker file

# bash is not required, it is just to allow runing scripts as we did before in circle.yml
# git allowes to pull dependencies from git repos directly (using git urls)
RUN apk add --update bash git
# make sure yarn is avalable for usage in build scripts (and print location and version)
RUN which yarn && yarn --version;

# all following packages are there to support yarn/node-gyp with building canvas see test last line
RUN apk add --update cairo cairo-dev g++ make rsync openssh

RUN mkdir -p /src/
WORKDIR /src/

RUN yarn global add node-sass

# for developing this file, testing that yarn can install canvas locally by installing it globally
# RUN yarn global add canvas@1.6.4 --exact;
