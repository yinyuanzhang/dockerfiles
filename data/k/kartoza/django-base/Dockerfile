# This is a base image for django projects. It is based on the 
# python base image (which in turn is based on debian). You should
# use the FROM dockerfile directive to inherit from this file
# and then install your requirements like this:
#
# ADD REQUIREMENTS.txt /REQUIREMENTS.txt
# RUN pip install -r /REQUIREMENTS.txt
# RUN pip install uwsgi
#
# This image makes some other assumptions in particular:
# 
# * nodejs / npm / yuglify are installed to compress django resources
# * uwsgi runs on port 8080
# * uwsgi is set up to serve the django project out of /home/web/django_project
# * the WORKDIR will be set to /home/web/django_project
# * uwsgi will serve up static resources from /home/web/django_project/static
# * uwsgi will serve up media resources from /home/web/django_project/media
# * Your project is mounted into /home/web/django_project from a docker volume
# 
#
# NOTE: Django itself is not installed in this image - you must add it in your
# REQUIREMENTS.txt file.
