# When the container starts, it should run the lobste.rs server using the
# start-lobsters.sh bash file that we copied above.  This is a common
# "gotcha" to people new to containers: unlike VMs, each container is based
# on a process (in this case, rails, which is started at the end of
# start-lobsters.sh) and will be shutdown when that process stops.
