# Axle-Base Dockerfile
#
# The container built from this Dockerfile serves no other purpose then to
# expose and host volumes and bind-mounts. So a lean 1.5mb busybox image is
# best for the job.
#
# Pull this image with `docker pull radial/axle-base` to use as a volume
# container for bind mounts and other persistent data that needs access from
# multiple containers.

FROM            radial/busyboxplus:base

# Simple program to keep the container alive and do nothing
COPY            IDLE /usr/bin/IDLE
CMD             ["IDLE"]
