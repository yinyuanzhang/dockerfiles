# dev-catalogue repository has been made public.  Hence, copying selected
# code into the image at this point is not needed any more and should
# in fact be avoided.  Instead, do a git clone at the final image.

# RUN cd /opt/reTHINK && mkdir GitHubRepos

# we should rather do a git pull here and use proper tags
# to pull a stable version out of the repo.
# RUN cd /opt/reTHINK/GitHubRepos && mkdir dev-catalogue
# COPY . /opt/reTHINK/GitHubRepos/dev-catalogue
