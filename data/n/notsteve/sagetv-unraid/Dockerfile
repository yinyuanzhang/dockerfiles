# SageTV Docker file for UNRAID.
# 
# Unraid will rebuild the docker image anytime a change is made to the
# configuration. This causes the SageTv configuration to get lost.
# This Docker tries to work around this by copying the entire executable
# directory to the unraid persistent directory which is mapped to /sagetv
#
# Based on coppit/sagetv-server
