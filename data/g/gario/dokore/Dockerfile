#
# Kore Compatible Docker Container
#
# This image can be used to build binaries that are compatible with
# the environment on the Kore cluster.
#
# For example, to build ESTools you would take the following steps:
#
# $ docker run --rm -ti -v ~/:/data gario/dokore
# bash-4.2# cd /data/ESTools/scripts
# bash-4.2# ./cmake_setup_build.py --release ../build-kore
# bash-4.2# cd ../build-kore
# bash-4.2# make -j
#
# Inside the build-kore directory, you'll have a binary that is
# compatible with Kore. Note that the directory is physically on the
# host machine. In this way, you can work normally on your machine
# (e.g., update git sources, test the executable), and only perform
# the compilation through the docker image. I.e., after updating
# sources you can rebuild the binary by doing:
#
# $ docker run --rm -ti -v ~/:/data dokore
# bash-4.2# cd /data/ESTools/build-kore
# bash-4.2# make -j
#
