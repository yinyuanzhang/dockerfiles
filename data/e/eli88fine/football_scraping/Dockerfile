#### NOTE, docker-toolbox must be used within a subdirectory of C:\Users in order to mount volumes

### If VirtualBox is started in administrative mode and then the machine inside there is used and a volume is mounted to the container, then it seems to work. but copy/paste isn't working inside the VirtualBox



### 6/2/18: Start VirtualBox in adimnistrator mode, start docker quickstart in administrator mode, use this: docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v /c/Users/gitRepos/football_scraping/output:/mnt -w /mnt eli88fine/eli-laura-kenny:historical-data-scraper bash
########## may not need to start virtual box in administrator mode, just the docker quickstart
### to run single script: docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v /c/Users/gitRepos/football_scraping/output:/mnt -w /usr/src eli88fine/eli-laura-kenny:historical-data-scraper python hello_world.py
