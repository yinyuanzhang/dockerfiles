# Image name: faucet/test-host

# Note that mininet is extremeley persnickity about the underlying versions, since small changes in
# command output will break the mininet parsing. E.g., different verions of 'ping' will have slightly
# different output that cause the tests to fail (on debian). Or, on alpine the '/bin/sh' program
# would output excess control-characters that confused mininet yet again.
#
# This host is built on top of ubuntu which is the same as the base-test image so should be most stable.
