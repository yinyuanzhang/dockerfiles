For more proper versions, see branches of this repository. These pickles are
intended for Python 3, and have general listings of Dockerfiles from previous
analysis. They are organized by dates.

 - [dockerfiles-01-13-2019.pkl](dockerfiles-01-13-2019.pkl): I believe is the original v1.0.0 release, with about ~129K Dockerfiles. This includes primarily the container names.
 - [dockerfiles-02-16-2017.pkl](dockerfiles-02-16-2017.pkl) is a small set of scientific Dockerfiles I generated for early work in 2017. These, along with names, also include the Dockerfiles contents. This could be used as a small set to test an analysis, and likely most of the containers are deprecated.
 - [dockerfiles-01-05-2020.pkl](dockerfiles-01-05-2020.pkl) an updated set of 96,767 from January 2020 (list of names).
